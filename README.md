# ROSE-Camera-Editor
I recently recovered this project I started around 2010. It's basically a camera motion editor for the game ROSE online using XNA 3.0 and .NET 4.5.

I managed to get back the sources but it wouldn't most likely compile again in this current state!
You can use it for education purpose, though.
